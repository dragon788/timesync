Errors
======

Error types from the TimeSync API.

.. contents::

Errors will consist of an error number which matches the HTTP status code to be
returned, an error name, and a further informational text. The existence of the
"error" key indicates an error.

In the docs following, string literals are indicated by double quotes (as in
JSON standard), variables/tokens are indicated by lowercase_with_underscore,
and plus signs indicate concatenation for building strings using tokens from
the context.

The following error codes will exist:

-------------------

1. Object not found
-------------------

To be returned if the server receives a valid key (e.g. Time ID or Activity
Slug) which does not match an object in the database.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "status": 404,
        "error": "Object not found",
        "text": "Nonexistent " + object
    }

---------------

2. Server error
---------------

A generic catch-all for when there is a server error outside of the client's
control.  This may be the result of an uncaught exception, a database error, or
any other condition which renders the server unable to process a valid request.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "status": 500,
        "error": "Server error",
        "text": server_error //(e.g. exception text or sql error)
    }

----------------------

3. Invalid foreign key
----------------------

A client attempts to make a POST request to create or update an object, but the
new object sent by the client contains a foreign key parameter which does not
point to a valid object in the database. (E.g. the client sends a new time
which does not have a valid project.)

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "status": 409
        "error": "Invalid foreign key",
        "text": "The " + object_type + " does not contain a valid " + foreign_key + " reference"
    }

-------------

4. Bad object
-------------

A client attempts to make a POST request to create or update an object, but the
new object sent by the client contains a non-existent key, lacks a necessary
key, or contains an invalid value for a key (e.g. a time with a string in the
duration field.)

.. code-block:: javascript

    unknown_field_error = {
        "status": 400
        "error": "Bad object",
        "text": object_type + " does not have a " + field_name + " field"
    }
    missing_field_error = {
        "status": 400
        "error": "Bad object",
        "text": "The " + object_type + " is missing a " + field_name
    }
    invalid_field_error = {
        "status": 400
        "error": "Bad object",
        "text": "Field " + field_name + " of " + object_type + " should be " +
                    expected_type + " but was sent as " + received_type
    }

---------------------

5. Invalid identifier
---------------------

This error would be returned when an identifier field (e.g. time ID or activity
slug) is malformed or otherwise not valid for use. This is to be distinguished
from Object not found: Object not found occurs when a perfectly valid,
well-formed identifier is supplied, but no object matching the identifier could
be found; an identifier is considered invalid if it does not match the expected
format (e.g. a slug with special characters or a non-numeric ID field).

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "status": 400
        "error": "The provided identifier was invalid",
        "text": "Expected " + (slug|id) + " but received " + received_identifier
    }

-------------------

6. Invalid username
-------------------

This error is returned when the username passed for authentication is not a
valid username.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "status": 401
        "error": "Invalid username",
        "text": "${username} is not a valid username"
    }

-------------------------

7. Authentication failure
-------------------------

This error is returned when authentication fails for a valid user. The text of
the error may change based on what kind of authentication backend the TimeSync
server is running.

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "status": 401
        "error": "Authentication failure",
        "text": "Invalid password" / "Bad oAuth token" / etc
    }
