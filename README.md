TimeSync is the OSU Open Source Lab's time tracking system. It's designed to be
simple, have a sane API, and make sense while allowing users to track their
time spent on various projects and activities.

This repository contains the TimeSync API specifications and none of the
code. For an implementation of TimeSync check out the
[timesync-node repository](https://github.com/osuosl/timesync-node)
